as a Data Analyst focus on Financial Analyst I'll be getting involved in everything from capturing requirements, 

modelling data and producing automated reports that deliver financial insights at the click of a button! 

Our client is the finance team at PPF Corporation. We want to take them on a journey to become a data-driven organisation

some of the challenges in working on this project are

1. Ingesting the monthly CSVs stored on SharePoint/Teams, modifying the combine function to remove header rows and dealing with 

   dates in a different format to your local region. (E.g. working with US dates when on a PC with UK regional settings).

2. Bringing in Reference Data (Excel) including daily exchange rates: re-shaping and merging this with actuals (on date/Currency Code)
   to calculate values in Reporting Currency (US $).

3. Creating the income statement measures which show Actual/Budget values, running totals and percentages all within the same column

4. Creating a waterfall chart using the native waterfall visual and custom visuals (e.g. Zebra BI) for visual storytelling and variance analysis.
   
6. Development of key ratios (e.g. Cost:Income Ratio, Effective Tax Rate) and analysis of these by organizational unit/over
  
   time by use of a bullet chart, scatter plot, line graph and matrix which interact with each other for cross-filter analysis
